    <br/>
    -Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.

    -Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
    <br/>
    -Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
    <br/>
    -Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.
    <br/>
    -Lasagna noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.
    <br/>
    -Cheeses: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.
    <br/>
